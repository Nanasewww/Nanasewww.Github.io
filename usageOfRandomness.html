										<br><b><i>Slay the Spire</i></b> is a roguelike deck-building game (DBG) developed by MegaCrit. In this game, the player chooses one of four characters to ascend a spire of multiple floors from three Actions by battling with enemies and the Big Boss through a collectible card game-based system, which requires the player to  adopt feasible strategies to construct an effective deck. It was nominated for several accolades in 2019 and is considered the originator of  roguelike deck-building games. With over 700 hours of playtime, it has been one of my favorite games since 2019. After trying many other card games, I still deem it  the best roguelike deck-building game ever. 
										<br>What makes <i>Slay the Spire</i> so attractive? There are many different answers to this question. Compared to other complicated card games, it is easy to learn, and even new beginners can quickly get started. Although some of the four characters may be slightly stronger than the other, the balance has been maintainedamong different characters and  different cards. It also provides a suitable Workshop where players can upload their own DIY characters. In this article, I will specifically discuss the wise usage of randomness in <i>Slay the Spire</i>. 
										<br>There are two types of randomness: input randomness and output randomness, also known as pre-luck and post-luck. The input randomness means that the random event occurs before the player gets to make a decision. On the contrary, the output randomness is that the player makes a decision first, and then the game tells what will happen. For example, playing a card that can deal 4-10 damage is output randomness because only after the card is played can the player find out the exact damage. And the five cards drawn by the player at the beginning of a turn are input randomness, as the player can then decide what to do with these cards. The procedurally generated levels in a roguelike game can also be regarded as input randomness. 
										<br><i>Slay the Spire</i> achieved a good balance between these two kinds of randomness in the game. On the basis of this balance, it tried to increase the proportion of input randomness in random events. In each Action, the player can see the complete procedurally generated map and choose a way before getting started. The intention of monsters is shown every turn, helping players decide whether to deal more damage or gain more blocks. After each combat, three cards will be dropped, and players can choose to take one or not. Random <i>Events</i> in unknown rooms often offer players multiple options to make a better choice according to the current situation. The benefits that input randomness brings are obvious. It maintains the randomness of a roguelike game while making it less "random." Players with good luck may get the cards they want in Action 1 or encounter a boss that is easier for their decks than others. Still, the higher proportion of input randomness would strengthen the influence of the player's decisions and weaken the power of luck in this game. In the face of failure, players tend to take it as a result of unwise choices instead of  bad luck. This way, it can help vent their frustration and inspire them to try it again. 
										<br>In Role-Playing Games (RPGs), the hit chance is not 100%, and the crit chance also affects the actual damage of a shot. It seems to be a standard design, but <i>Slay the Spire</i> has almost no cards with a hit rate of less than 100% or random damage. Resource allocation is crucial for roguelike games, as death is permanent. Players should consider wisely using limited resources to reach a higher level. In <i>Slay the Spire</i>, plenty of resources are easy to be found, such as <i>Cards, Gold, Potions</i>> and <i>Relics</i>. What is usually overlooked is that HP is also a vital resource because the ways of healing HP are  limited and often take away the opportunity to obtain other resources, such as missing a chance to upgrade a card at a Reset floor. If the attack could be avoided and the specific damage is random, which means there is output randomness after a card is played, it would be difficult for players to control the HP resource. For example, the player may expect to kill the monster in this turn, but it is not implemented because of the output randomness. Therefore, the player would lose more HP resources as a price. This would increase the proportion of luck in the game and make players feel frustrated when they fail in a run and think, "I have made a lot of wise choices but still lost because of bad luck". For Slay the Spire, it is insightful to increase the importance of players' individual choices by weakening the role of output randomness in every combat. Players can focus more on their decisions and how those decisions change their resources rather than paying too much attention to luck. 
										<br>However, this doesn’ t mean that output randomness shouldn’ t be added to any card game. Slay the Spire also keeps output randomness in some cards, such as the blue card White Noise , the purple card Foreign Influence  and so on. Adding cards with output randomness to deck not only can enhance the pleasure of players, but can also give them the expectation of taking advantage of cards in some special situations. Besides, the application of randomness differs from thedesigns of card games. In <i>Chrono Ark</i>, the hit chance isn’ t 100% for each attack, but we cannot deny that it is also an outstanding roguelike deck-building game. There are more ways to gain life points in Chrono Ark, and they don t take up too many other resources. Because of this design, players will be more tolerant of the extra life loss caused by output randomness. In short, elements in a game can influence each other, and there is no fixed design criterion of randomness suitable for all games.
